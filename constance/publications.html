                  Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rare cancer, characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis, and has limited treatment options. The current standard of care in nonmetastatic settings is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), but treatment efficacy varies substantially across patients. This heterogeneity is still poorly understood, partly due to the paucity of curated TNBC data. Here we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) leveraging whole-slide images and clinical information to predict, at diagnosis, the histological response to NACT for early TNBC women patients. To overcome the biases of small-scale studies while respecting data privacy, we conducted a multicentric TNBC study using federated learning, in which patient data remain secured behind hospitals’ firewalls. We show that local ML models relying on whole-slide images can predict response to NACT but that collaborative training of ML models further improves performance, on par with the best current approaches in which ML models are trained using time-consuming expert annotations. Our ML model is interpretable and is sensitive to specific histological patterns. This proof of concept study, in which federated learning is applied to real-world datasets, paves the way for future biomarker discovery using unprecedentedly large datasets.

                  The Yeo-Johnson (YJ) transformation is a standard parametrized per-feature unidimensional transformation often used to Gaussianize features in machine learning. In this paper, we investigate the problem of applying the YJ transformation in a cross-silo Federated Learning setting under privacy constraints. For the first time, we prove that the YJ negative log-likelihood is in fact convex, which allows us to optimize it with exponential search. We numerically show that the resulting algorithm is more stable than the state-of-the-art approach based on the Brent minimization method. Building on this simple algorithm and Secure Multiparty Computation routines, we propose SECUREFEDYJ, a federated algorithm that performs a pooled-equivalent YJ transformation without leaking more information than the final fitted parameters do. Quantitative experiments on real data demonstrate that, in addition to being secure, our approach reliably normalizes features across silos as well as if data were pooled, making it a viable approach for safe federated feature Gaussianization.

                  While federated learning is a promising approach for training deep learning models over distributed
                  sensitive datasets, it presents new challenges for machine learning, especially when applied in the
                  medical domain where multi-centric data heterogeneity is common. Building on previous domain
                  adaptation works, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach for deep learning
                  architectures
                  via the introduction of local-statistic batch normalization (BN) layers, resulting in
                  collaboratively-trained, yet center-specific models. This strategy improves robustness to data
                  heterogeneity while
                  also reducing the potential for information leaks by not sharing the center-specific layer activation
                  statistics. We benchmark the proposed method on the classification of tumorous histopathology
                  image patches extracted from the Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 datasets. We show that our approach
                  compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art methods, especially for transfer learning across
                  datasets.

                  Neural Networks (NN) are today increasingly used in Machine Learning where they have become deeper and
                  deeper to accurately model or classify high-level abstractions of data. Their development however
                  also gives rise to important data privacy risks. This observation motives Microsoft researchers to
                  propose a framework, called Cryptonets. The core idea is to combine simplifications of the NN with
                  Fully Homomorphic Encryptions (FHE) techniques to get both confidentiality of the manipulated data and
                  efficiency of the processing. While efficiency and accuracy are demonstrated when the number of
                  non-linear layers is small (e.g. 2), Cryptonets unfortunately becomes ineffective for deeper NNs which
                  let the privacy preserving problem open in these contexts. This work successfully addresses this
                  problem by combining several new ideas including the use of the batch normalization principle and the
                  splitting of the learning phase in several iterations. We experimentally validate the soundness of
                  our approach with a neural network with 6 non-linear layers. When applied to the MNIST database, it
                  competes with the accuracy of the best non-secure versions, thus significantly improving Cryptonets.
                  Additionally, we applied our approach to secure a neural network used for face recognition. This
                  problem is usually considered much harder than the MNIST hand-written digits recognition and can
                  definitely not be addressed with a simple network like Cryptonets. By combining our new ideas with an
                  iterative (learning) approach we experimentally show that we can build an FHE-friendly network
                  achieving good accuracy for face recognition.

                  The secure two-party computation (S2PC) protocols SHADE and GSHADE have been introduced by Bringer et
                  al. in the last two years. The protocol GSHADE permits to compute different distances (Hamming,
                  Euclidean, Mahalanobis) quite efficiently and is one of the most efficient compared to other S2PC
                  methods. Thus, this protocol can be used to efficiently compute one-to-many identification for several
                  biometrics data (iris, face, fingerprint). In this paper, we introduce two extensions of GSHADE. The
                  first one enables us to evaluate new multiplicative functions. This way, we show how to apply
                  GSHADE to a classical machine learning algorithm. The second one is a new proposal to secure GSHADE
                  against malicious adversaries following the recent dual execution and cut-and-choose strategies. The
                  additional cost is very small. By preserving the GSHADE's structure, our extensions are very efficient
                  compared to other S2PC methods.

                  In iris-based video authentication, the best frames from the video are selected in order to compare
                  them to a reference data. As biometric data are sensitive, a non-secure matching score evaluation
                  can leak private information. We here focus on Garbled circuits which are widely employed to securely
                  compare biometric data. Our main idea consists in introducing a new efficient partially re-usable
                  garbled circuit. To do that, we take advantage of the similarities between templates from the same
                  video in order to reduce the cost of several secure matching evaluations on close inputs. We validate
                  our proposal through experiments showing that it is practical.

                  This paper analyses the unlinkability and the irreversibility of the iris biometric template
                  protection system based on Bloom filters introduced at ICB 2013. Hermans et al. presented at BIOSIG
                  2014 an
                  attack on the unlinkability of these templates. In the worst case, their attack succeeds with
                  probability at least 96%. But in their attack, they assume protected templates generated from the same
                  iriscode. In this paper, we analyze unlinkability on protected templates generated with two different
                  iriscodes coming from the same iris, and we moreover introduce irreversibility analysis that
                  exploits non-uniformity of the data. Our experiments thus practically demonstrate new vulnerabilities
                  of the scheme.

                  Since the seminal paper of Ratha et al. in 2001 that introduced cancelable biometrics, inner
                  permutation of biometric templates has been widely suggested as one of the basic components to protect
                  biometric data against compromised or cross-checking between two databases. In this paper, we study
                  the case of iris biometrics where an inner permutation corresponds to shuffling the bits of a
                  template in order to diversify the stored data. We analyze the security brought by a permutation and
                  underline the impact of non-uniformity of templates on the robustness of cancelable biometrics: we
                  introduce new attack strategies on permuted biometric databases that enable to reconstruct part of the
                  permutation, leading to a potential privacy leakage. We finally suggest ways to improve
                  efficiently the protection, by designing specific countermeasures, with no impact on accuracy and a
                  low impact on the overall architecture of the system.

                  standard of care in non-metastatic settings is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), with the goal of
                  breast-conserving surgery and for an in vivo assessment of chemosensitivity. However, the efficacy of
                  this treatment varies significantly across patients, and this histological response heterogeneity is
                  still poorly understood partly due to the paucity of available curated TNBC data. Motivated by this
                  problem, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) to predict at diagnosis the histological
                  response to NACT for early TNBC patients. To overcome the known biases of related small scale studies
                  while respecting data privacy, we conduct, for the first time, a TNBC study in a multi-centric fashion
                  behind hospitals’ firewalls using collaborative Federated Learning (FL). Thereby allowing access
                  to enough TNBC data to sustain a complete response heterogeneity investigation. We show evidence that
                  local ML models relying on Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) at diagnosis are able to predict the
                  histological response to NACT as accurately as current clinical approaches, which rely on
                  time-consuming expert annotations. We demonstrate that collaborative training further improves
                  performance
                  over single-center training outperforming clinical methods. Our ML model is interpretable by design,
                  and we show that it is sensitive to specific histological patterns. While we identify known
                  predictive biomarkers among them, this proof of concept for real-world collaborative FL paves the way
                  for future biomarker discovery using unprecedently large datasets.

                  Since 2014, the NIH funded iDASH (integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, SHaring) National
                  Center for Biomedical Computing has hosted yearly competitions on the topic of private computing for
                  genomic data. For one track of the 2020 iteration of this competition, participants were challenged to
                  produce an approach to federated learning (FL) training of genomic cancer prediction models using
                  differential privacy (DP), with submissions ranked according to held-out test accuracy for a given set
                  of DP budgets. More precisely, in this track, we are tasked with training a supervised model for
                  the prediction of breast cancer occurrence from genomic data split between two virtual centers while
                  ensuring data privacy with respect to model transfer via DP. In this article, we present our 3rd
                  place submission to this competition. During the competition, we encountered two main challenges
                  discussed in this article: i) ensuring correctness of the privacy budget evaluation and ii) achieving
                  an acceptable trade-off between prediction performance and privacy budget.

                  Federated Learning enables one to jointly train a machine learning model across distributed clients
                  holding sensitive datasets. In real-world settings, this approach is hindered by expensive
                  communication and privacy concerns. Both of these challenges have already been addressed individually,
                  resulting in competing optimisations. In this article, we tackle them simultaneously for one of
                  the first times. More precisely, we adapt compression-based federated techniques to additive secret
                  sharing, leading to an efficient secure aggregation protocol, with an adaptable security level. We
                  prove its privacy against malicious adversaries and its correctness in the semi-honest setting.
                  Experiments on deep convolutional networks demonstrate that our secure protocol achieves high accuracy
                  with low communication costs. Compared to prior works on secure aggregation, our protocol has a lower
                  communication and computation costs for a similar accuracy.

                  Neural Networks (NN) are today increasingly used in Machine Learning where they have become deeper and
                  deeper to accurately model or classify high-level abstractions of data. Their development however
                  also gives rise to important data privacy risks. This observation motives Microsoft researchers to
                  propose a framework, called Cryptonets. The core idea is to combine simplifications of the NN with
                  Fully Homomorphic Encryptions (FHE) techniques to get both confidentiality of the manipulated data and
                  efficiency of the processing. While efficiency and accuracy are demonstrated when the number of
                  non-linear layers is small (eg 22), Cryptonets unfortunately becomes ineffective for deeper NNs which
                  let the problem of privacy preserving matching open in these contexts. This work successfully
                  addresses this problem by combining the original ideas of Cryptonets' solution with the batch
                  normalization principle introduced at ICML 2015 by Ioffe and Szegedy. We experimentally validate the
                  soundness of our approach with a neural network with 66 non-linear layers. When applied to the MNIST
                  database, it competes the accuracy of the best non-secure versions, thus significantly improving
                  Cryptonets.

                  In this work, we develop an unlinkability and irreversibility analysis of the so-called Bloom
                  filter-based iris biometric template protection introduced at ICB 2013. We go further than the
                  unlinkability analysis of Hermans et al. presented at BIOSIG 2014. Firstly, we analyse unlinkability
                  on protected templates built from two different iriscodes coming from the same iris whereas Hermans
                  et al. analysed only protected templates from the same iriscode. Moreover, we introduce an
                  irreversibility analysis that exploits non-uniformity of the biometric data. Our experiments
                  demonstrate new
                  vulnerabilities of this scheme. Then we will discuss the security of other similar protected biometric
                  templates based on Bloom filters that have been suggested in the literature since 2013. Finally,
                  we suggest a Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) protocol, that benefits of the alignment-free feature
                  of this Bloom filter construction, in order to compute efficiently and securely the matching
                  scores.<br />

                  In this chapter, we describe how to perform a secure and efficient IrisCode-based identification. In
                  this use case, the first party has an IrisCode, the second party has one or several IrisCodes and
                  they would like to discover whether the first party’s IrisCode is close to at least one IrisCode
                  belonging to the second party without revealing any information about their own IrisCodes to the
                  opposing party. Secure Two-Party Computation (S2PC) protocols are dedicated to this use case because
                  they enable two parties to jointly evaluate a function over their inputs while preserving the
                  privacy of their inputs. In this chapter, we explain how to efficiently use S2PC protocols for secure
                  iris-based identification.

                  Machine learning based on Neural Networks (NN) is increasingly used in areas such as medical
                  diagnosis, computer vision and speech recognition. To accurately model or classify high-level
                  abstractions
                  of data, they have become deeper, leading to new algorithms, called deep neural networks, with more
                  and more layers. Their unprecedented accuracy has turned them into the foundation of many new
                  services and applications. Recently, Cryptonets has been introduced by Microsoft to combine these NN
                  computations with homomorphic encryptions to ensure confidentiality of manipulated data.
                  Considering face recognition, this could be a must-have feature to have to ensure privacy. Our work
                  improves their proposal by modifying underlying NNs while keeping excellent accuracy performances.
                  For instance, following their experiment with the MNIST database, we obtain with our experiments an
                  accuracy similar to that for the non-secure version, achieving a significant improvement compared to
                  Cryptonets. This can be seen as another step to handle the many layers of deep NN with encrypted data.
