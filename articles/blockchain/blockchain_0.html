<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The first blockchain has been introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 in the paper <cite>[Nak08]</cite>. The blockchain has been created to build a cryptocurrency called bitcoin without third trusted party. This blockchain is the ledger of this cryptocurrency and stores all transactions from the genesis transaction. A blockchain has the following properties:
<ul>
	<li> Openness: everyone can check all the blocks of the blockchain </li>
	<li> Integrity: the blockchain is copied on different computers which avoids an attacker to hack it </li>
	<li> Without trusted third party: each client play a role in the management of the database </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The blockchain has been created for bitcoin but is now used in various altcoins (other cryptocurrencies) and altchains (aim is not currency but distributed consensus).
</p>

<p>To make it easier the understanding of the blockchain, we present its functioning in real bitcoin applications with three subjects: a client called Alice who spends bictoins, a seller called Bob who receives bitcoins and a miner called Mickael who checks the validity of the transactions.
</p>

<p>Firstly we present the functioning of the blockchain on the client side (in Section <u><a href="?page=1">Client side: How to receive and send a transaction</a></u>). Then we explain the structure of the blockchain (ledger) to store the transactions (in Section <u><a href="?page=2">The blockchain to store all the transactions</a></u>). Finally we explain how transactions are checked and validated by miners (in Section <u><a href="?page=3">Miner side: The validation of transactions</a></u>).
