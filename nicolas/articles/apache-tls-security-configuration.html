          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">1. Basic security</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Minimizing the amount of data that is revealed to potential attackers is a key way to safeguard your web server. This can include details such as the version number of Apache, PHP, and the operating system. This type of
            information is often included in HTTP headers, but it can be hidden to better protect your server. To achieve this:<br />
            <br />
            <span class="text-code text-light">
              <span class="text-secondary"># Hide server version on error pages</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">ServerSignature</span> Off<br />
              <span class="text-secondary"># Only return Apache in server header</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">ServerTokens</span> Prod<br />
            </span>
            <br />
            <p>
              Using TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 on an apache server is important because these versions of the TLS protocol provide stronger security features and improved performance compared to older versions. Some of the key benefits of using TLS
              1.2 and TLS 1.3 include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Stronger encryption</b>: TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 use stronger encryption algorithms and key lengths to protect data transmitted over the internet.</li>
              <li><b>Improved performance</b>: TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are designed to be more efficient than older versions of the TLS protocol, which can result in faster connection times and improved overall performance.</li>
              <li>
                <b>Improved security</b>: TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 include additional security features, such as Perfect Forward Secrecy, which helps to prevent an attacker from using previously recorded traffic to decrypt current traffic.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Overall, using TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 helps to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data transmitted over the internet, and it is an important security measure for any server that handles sensitive
              information.
            </p>

          </div>

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">2. Cipher Suite</h1>
          There are four main types of encryption algorithms:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Key exchange</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Block encryption</li>
            <li>Message Authentication</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Some of these algorithms, such as RC4, DH, 3DES, and EXP, should be avoided due to their lower levels of security. It is important to prioritize the use of more secure algorithms in order to balance security with accessibility for
          customers.<br />
          <br />

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">4. Security headers</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            The <b class="text-code">X-Content-Type-Options</b> response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the <span class="text-code">Content-Type</span> headers should be followed and
            not be changed. The header allows you to <b>avoid MIME type sniffing</b> by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Content Security Policy (CSP)</b> is an added layer of security that helps to detect and <b>mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks</b>. These attacks are used for
            everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware distribution. This CSP configuration is highly secure, but it is recommended to test it first to ensure that it does not block third party scripts.
            <a class="link-success" href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">CSP Evaluator</a> is an excellent tool for testing your CSP configuration.<br />
            <br />
            The <b>HTTP Strict-Transport-Security</b> response header (often abbreviated as <b>HSTS</b>) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">5. DH Param</h1>
          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            <p>
              Diffie-Hellman (DH) is a cryptographic algorithm used to establish a shared secret between two parties. It's commonly used in various cryptographic protocols to ensure secure communications over an untrusted network, such as
              the internet. DH parameters, often simply termed "DH params", play an essential role in this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's crucial for security reasons that these parameters are generated in a strong and robust manner. Specifically, the size of the DH group (measured in bits) directly influences the strength of the cryptographic operation.
              Modern best practices recommend using a 4096-bit DH group for most applications.
            </p>
            <p>To generate a 4096-bits DH group using the OpenSSL toolkit, you can use the following command:</p>

            <span class="text-code text-light">
              <span class="text-secondary"># Generate 4096-bits DH group</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">openssl</span> dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem <span class="text-info">4096</span><br />
              <br />
            </span>
            <p>After generating the DH parameters, you might want to inspect or verify them. To check the content and details of the generated DH group, use</p>
            <span class="text-code text-light"> <span class="text-danger">openssl</span> dh -in /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem -text<br /> </span>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once you've generated the DH params, you need to integrate them into your server configuration to use them. For servers running Apache, the directive is `SSLOpenSSLConfCmd`. Here's how you can specify the path to the DH params in the
              server configuration:
            </p>
            <span class="text-code text-light"> <span class="text-danger">SSLOpenSSLConfCmd</span> DHParameters "/etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem"</span>
          </div>
          <h2 class="my-5 fs-4">Complete configuration</h2>

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">Conclusion</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-5 text-light">
            In conclusion, it is vital to prioritize the security of your Apache web server in order to protect your website and its users from potential threats. By following best practices such as minimizing the amount of data revealed to
            attackers, using secure encryption algorithms, and implementing security headers and cipher suites, you can significantly enhance the security of your server. It is important to regularly review and update your security measures
            to stay ahead of evolving threats and to maintain the trust of your users. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure the safety and integrity of your web server and the sensitive data it handles.<br />
