            In this article, we will provide expert tips on how to enhance the security of your Nginx web server. We will cover key areas such as system security, SSL/TLS security, and data security. By following these best practices, you
            can aim for an A+ rating on Qualys SSL Labs and protect your server from potential threats.<br />
            <br />
            One objective can be to have a grade of A+ on <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" class="link-success"><b>Qualys SSL Labs</b></a>.

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">1. Basic security</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Minimizing the amount of data that is revealed to potential attackers is a key way to safeguard your web server. This can include details such as the version number of Nginx, PHP, and the operating system. This type of
            information is often included in HTTP headers, but it can be hidden to better protect your server. To achieve this:<br />
            <br />
            <span class="text-code text-light copy-code">
              <span class="text-secondary"># Only return Nginx in server header</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">server_tokens</span> off;
            </span>
          </div>

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">2. Security headers</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            The <b class="text-code">X-Content-Type-Options</b> response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the <span class="text-code">Content-Type</span> headers should be followed and
            not be changed. The header allows you to <b>avoid MIME type sniffing</b> by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Content Security Policy (CSP)</b> is an added layer of security that helps to detect and <b>mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks</b>. These attacks are used for
            everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware distribution.<br />
            <br />
            The <b>HTTP Strict-Transport-Security</b> response header (often abbreviated as <b>HSTS</b>) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should
            automatically be converted to HTTPS.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="text-code text-light">
              <span class="text-secondary"># Security headers</span><br />
              <span class="text-secondary">## X-Content-Type-Options: avoid MIME type sniffing</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">add_header</span> X-Content-Type-Options <span class="text-info">nosniff</span>;<br />
              <span class="text-secondary">## Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Yes</span><br />
              <span class="text-secondary">## No 'script-src' directive, you need to test it yourself</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">add_header</span> Content-Security-Policy <span class="text-info">"object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none'; require-trusted-types-for 'script'; frame-ancestors 'self';"</span>;<br />
              <span class="text-secondary">## Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Yes</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">add_header</span> Strict-Transport-Security <span class="text-info">"max-age=15552001; includeSubdomains; preload"</span>;<br />
            </span>
          </div>

          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">3. Cipher Suite</h1>
          There are four main types of encryption algorithms:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Key exchange</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Block encryption</li>
            <li>Message Authentication</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Some of these algorithms, such as RC4, DH, 3DES, and EXP, should be avoided due to their lower levels of security. It is important to prioritize the use of more secure algorithms in order to balance security with accessibility for
          customers.<br />
          <br />
          For more information on the security of different cipher suites, you can refer to the following link: <a href="https://ciphersuite.info/cs/?security=secure" class="link-success">https://ciphersuite.info/</a><br />

          <div class="lead fs-5 text-light">
            In conclusion, it is vital to prioritize the security of your Nginx web server in order to protect your website and its users from potential threats. By following best practices such as minimizing the amount of data revealed to
            attackers, using secure encryption algorithms, and implementing security headers and cipher suites, you can significantly enhance the security of your server. It is important to regularly review and update your security measures
            to stay ahead of evolving threats and to maintain the trust of your users. By taking these steps, you can help to ensure the safety and integrity of your web server and the sensitive data it handles.<br />
