              In the world of version control, it's crucial to keep your code repositories secure. Two tools that can help with this are <a href="https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit" class="link-info">shhgit</a> and
              <a href="https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks" class="link-info">gitleaks</a>.

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light py-3">
            Both shhgit and gitleaks are command line tools that can help you find sensitive information that has been committed to a git repository. However, they differ in a few key ways, which we'll explore in this article.
          </div>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light py-3">
            Gitleaks and shhgit are both tools for searching for sensitive information in Git repositories. Gitleaks searches for specific patterns of text, such as passwords and API keys but <b class="text-success">among all commits</b>,
            while shhgit searches for known sensitive patterns, such as private keys and passwords <b class="text-success">no matter if this is a Git repository or a directory</b>. Both tools can be used from the command line and are
            designed to be fast and efficient.
          </div>

          <h2 class="my-5 fs-3">Shhgit</h2>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Shhgit is a go binary that can handle git repository, but also regular files in directories. Here it's the git repository of shhgit:
            <a href="https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit" class="link-secondary">https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit</a>.<br />
            This tool is looking for <b>filenames</b>, <b>extensions</b> or <b>contents</b> matching a specific regex: <span class="text-warning">usernames</span> and <span class="text-warning">passwords</span>,
            <span class="text-warning">API tokens</span>, or <span class="text-warning">private keys</span>.<br />
            <br />
            <b class="text-success">How to install</b><br />
            Install <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" class="link-info">Go</a> for you platform.
            <span class="text-code text-light copy-code"><span class="text-danger">$</span> go get github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit</span>
            <span class="text-code text-light copy-code">
              <span class="text-secondary"># Don't forget to pick a directory for your shhgit configuration</span><br />
              <span class="text-secondary"># in this example, it's /opt/shhgit/</span><br />
              <span class="text-danger">$</span> curl -o <span class="text-code">/opt/shhgit/config.yaml</span> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eth0izzle/shhgit/master/config.yaml
            </span>
            <br />
            <b class="text-success">How to use</b><br />
            Your shhgit local path is <span class="text-code text-light">/opt/shhgit/</span> and you will scan your current directory <b>recursively</b>
            <span class="text-code text-light copy-code"><span class="text-danger">$</span> shhgit -local . -config-path /opt/shhgit/</span>

          </div>

          <h2 class="my-5 fs-4">Gitleaks</h2>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Gitleaks is a tool for searching for sensitive information in Git repositories. It can be used from the command line and is designed to be fast and efficient. It searches for patterns of text in the repository, such as passwords
            and API keys, and outputs the results in a human-readable format.
          </div>
          <br />
          <b class="text-success">How to install</b><br />

          <span class="text-code text-light copy-code">
            <span class="text-secondary"># For a temporary install</span><br />
            <span class="text-danger">$</span> curl -L https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases/download/v8.15.2/gitleaks_8.15.2_linux_x64.tar.gz -o /tmp/gitleaks_8.15.2_linux_x64.tar.gz <span class="text-danger">&&</span> tar xvzf

          <br />
          <b class="text-success">How to use</b><br />

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Once gitleaks is installed, you can use it to search for sensitive information in a Git repository. For example, the following command will search for instances of the word "password" in the current repository:
          </div>

          <span class="text-code text-light copy-code"> <span class="text-danger">$</span> gitleaks detect </span>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            This command will scan the entire repository and output a list of secrets found among all commits.
          </div>
          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Gitleaks is a powerful tool for finding sensitive information in Git repositories. It is fast and efficient, and can help you ensure that your codebase is secure.
          </div>
          <h1 class="my-5 fs-3">Conclusion</h1>

          <div class="lead fs-6 text-light">
            Secrets such as passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information can be exploited by hackers if they are not properly protected. This can lead to security breaches and other serious problems, such as data theft or damage to
            your company's reputation. Additionally, if secrets are left unsecured in your codebase, they can be accidentally exposed through things like code commits or public bug reports, which can also put your company at risk. By
            looking for secrets in your codebase and taking steps to protect them, you can help keep your company and its sensitive information safe from potential threats.
