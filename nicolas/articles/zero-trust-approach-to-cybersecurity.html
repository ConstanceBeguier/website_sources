            Zero trust architecture is a cybersecurity framework that was first proposed by <b>John Kindervag</b>, a Forrester Research analyst, in 2010. It was developed as a response to the increasingly complex and dynamic nature of
            cybersecurity threats, and the limitations of traditional security architectures that are based on the idea of building a strong perimeter around an organization's network and resources.<br />
            <br />
            Kindervag argued that in today's interconnected world, where employees and devices are constantly accessing network resources from a variety of locations and devices,
            <b class="text-danger">it is impossible to effectively secure an organization's network by simply building a strong perimeter around it</b>. Instead, he proposed the concept of zero trust architecture, which assumes that all
            network traffic is potentially malicious and requires verification before it is allowed access to network resources.

          <h2 class="my-5 fs-4">Core Architecture Principals</h2>

          <div class="lead fs-5 text-light py-3">
            One of the key principles of zero trust architecture is to <b>never trust, always verify</b>. This means that every access request, whether it comes from inside or outside the network, is treated the same and is subject to the
            same level of scrutiny. To implement zero trust architecture, organizations need to implement a variety of security controls, including <b>multi-factor authentication</b>, <b>network segmentation</b>, and
            <b>microsegmentation</b>.

          <div class="lead fs-5 text-light py-3">
            <b class="text-warning">Multi-factor authentication</b>, also known as two-factor authentication, requires users to provide more than one form of authentication when logging in to a system. This can include a password, a
            security token, or biometric data such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. <b class="text-warning">Network segmentation</b> involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments, each of which has its own security
            controls. <b class="text-warning">Microsegmentation</b> takes this a step further by creating fine-grained security policies that control access to individual resources or groups of resources.
          </div>
          <div class="lead fs-5 text-light py-3">
            Zero trust architecture has become increasingly popular in recent years as organizations seek to protect themselves from the growing threat of cyberattacks. It is particularly
            <b class="text-success">effective against attacks that involve lateral movement</b>, in which an attacker gains access to one part of a network and then uses that access to move laterally and compromise other parts of the
            network. By implementing zero trust architecture, organizations can prevent lateral movement and limit the scope of any potential breach.
